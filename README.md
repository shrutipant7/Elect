Building a basic Dapp for elections.
Tools used are here:
1. Web3 JS - enables client side app to talk to blockchain
2. Metamask - enables browser to talk to blockchain
3. Ganache - local development blockchain
4. Remix - smart contract IDE

This is a simple implementation using contract ABI and address for running our DApp in the front end without using complex implementation of truffle framework.
